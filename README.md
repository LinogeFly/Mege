# Mege

Mege (short for Meme Generator) is inspired by, and in some ways looks very similar to, [Imgflip: Meme Generator](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator) website. The website is very handy, but after been using it for a while I realized that it lacks certain features I would find useful in a day-to-day life of a meme creator.

The primary goal of this project is to learn and practice front-end development frameworks as well as ASP.NET Core. The secondary goal, and this is serious, is to build a simple web application to help creating memes!

## Important

This project is still very much work in progress. It started as proof of concept, then evolved into more of what could be called alpha version. The project still lacks multiple functional features as well it doesn't yet have a reasonable and good looking UX/UI.

## Features

New features, if comparing to [Imgflip: Meme Generator](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator):

- No watermark
- High images resolution
- Persisted settings for each meme template
- Freedom of moderating meme templates

## Things to learn and practice

- ASP.NET Core
- React
- Writing tests for React parts of the application
- BEM naming convention for custom CSS
- Have custom version of Bootstrap built from the source code
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture

## Roadmap

More information on what's left to do and what's going on is documented in [notes.md](notes.md) file in a very free, drafty and notes-like format.
